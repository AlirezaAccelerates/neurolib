### Contributing to the optimal control extension

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [neurolib](https://github.com/neurolib-dev/neurolib). We welcome bug reports through the issues tab and pull requests for fixes or improvements. You are warlmy invited to join our development efforts and make brain network modeling easier and more useful for all researchers.

We use the same coding standards (in particular, coding style) as the neurolib library.

#### Pull requests

To propose a change to the code, first clone (or fork) the repository to your own Github account. Then, create a branch and make some changes. You can then send a pull request to our repository and we will review and discuss your proposed changes.

More information on how to make pull requests can be found in the 
[Github help](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) pages.


#### Code style

Just like the `neurolib` library, we use the [black](https://github.com/psf/black) code formatter with the additional argument `--line-length=120`. We recommend using black directly in your IDE, for example in [VSCode](https://marcobelo.medium.com/setting-up-python-black-on-visual-studio-code-5318eba4cd00).

We use the [sphinx format](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html) for commenting code.
